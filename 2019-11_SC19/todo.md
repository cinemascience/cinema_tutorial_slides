## General
- test to see if any non-cinema developer can clone the repo
- remove multi-image example from cinema_explorer in tutorial home page
- update cinema_compare repo, and use the examples in the data directory
- put useful links in the readme.md for tutorial (access if we aren't able
      to pull the repo)
- remove tutorial slides from repo and provide a link to them instead
x same list of people as on Terry's poster
x outlines around all images
x check names and order on tutorial homepage
x note how to control the database.json file referenced
x Terry: where are the images (VisIt) used on the documentation site?
x create a single tutorial.html that has links to all viewers
x update or eliminate the 'index.html' at the top level
o pull materials/ up one level
o install things on remote server so the permissions thing doesn't interfere?
